  Description:
The Simple Notes Chrome extension offers a convenient way to take and manage notes while browsing. Whether you're conducting research, attending online classes, or simply jotting down quick thoughts, Simple Notes provides a minimalist and user-friendly interface. 

i have four files in this project namely: 
manifest.json
popup.html
popup.js
styles.css

popup.js: This contains the javascript code that handles the functionality of saving, clearing and syncing notes across devices

popup.html: This contains the code for UI of the chrome extension

styles.css: This contains the css for the chrome extension

There was no debate on design choice, i liked the concept of blue, white and grey.
